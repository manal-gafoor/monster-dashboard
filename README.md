# MonsterDashboard

This project is a prototype of a Figma design file, representing a simple UI for a Monster application. It uses Angular 16, and Tailwind CSS v3.4. 

The prototype is intended for use on a device with screen width 768px (as per the Figma), and hence, on screens larger than this breakpoint, there will be some white space on either side.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.16.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
